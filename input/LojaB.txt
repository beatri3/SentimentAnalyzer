I found the product affordable and reliable.
Customer service was rude, will not shop here again.
Fast shipping and well-packaged items.
The size chart was inaccurate, product doesn't fit.
I had a smooth return process, very satisfied.
Great discounts, saved a lot on my order.
The quality was below average, not what I expected.
The instructions were unclear, hard to assemble.
Friendly staff at the store, helped me find what I needed.
Perfect experience, would recommend to anyone!
